Why we need AOP?
15 statements in Alien Component is Business Logic
You cancel non Business logic statements and get separated class as Aspect
1. @Aspect

2. Advice
what? When I call show method I want to call log() in @Aspect class
 - @Before
 - @After
 - @Around
 - @Before

3. PointCut
where?
@Before("execution(public void show())")

4. add @Component to @Aspect class
5. add @EnableAspectJAutoProxy

Note: helper and Alien should be in same package
